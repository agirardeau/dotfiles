- DEALING WITH MULTIPLE FILES

BUFFERS
:e[dit] {bufferId}    - open a buffer for the specified {bufferId}. {bufferId}
                        can be specified as a full relative path or by the 
                        buffer number with preceding pound symbol, eg. "#2".
:b[uffer] {bufferId}  - open a buffer for the specified {bufferId}. {bufferId}
                        can be specified as a partial filename match or as the
                        buffer number.
:bad[d] {bufferId}    - opens a new buffer like :edit does but does not switch
                        from the current buffer or load the file contents for
                        the buffer.
:bd[elete] {bufferId} - delete the buffer specified by {bufferId}. {bufferId}
                        can be a number or partial match. Some data is retained
                        as an 'unlisted-buffer' (mark locations, etc).
